# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  # server:
  #   build:
  #     context: .
  #   environment:
  #     NODE_ENV: production
  #   ports:
  #     - 3000:3000
  #   depends_on:
  #     db:
  #       condition: service_healthy

  # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
  # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
  # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
  # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
  # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
  # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.
  db:
    image: postgres:17.0
    hostname: ${DB_HOST}
    ports:
      - "5432:${DB_PORT}"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${DB_NAME}
volumes:
  db-data:
# secrets:
#   db-password:
#     file: db/password.txt
